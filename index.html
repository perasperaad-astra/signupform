    GENERAL: 
    1. How do I get rid of the white line outside of the image container left side?
        -something to do with that margin:auto thing maybe...? or maybe something with the div containers needing to take up 100% of vw?
    2. How to get the div to show up behind the logo? How to apply proper transparency?
        -some issue w needing to apply diff z-indexes 
    3. How to put a mask in for the phone number field? Is there a step beyond the very basic placeholder I have?
    4. How to use :valid and :invalid for styling here? 
        -Why does using green for :valid also make the border of the whole form green?
    5. How to incorporate js and give error message w/ :invalid, incl. case where they are both blank?
        -maybe set up a keystroke event trigger on the second password slot-- if any new character does not match the character at the equiv index 
        in password 1, show a warning sign that the passwords don't match 
    6. How to style the fieldset/legend to match and not cause weird issues?
    7. Does the form have a bit of a shadow box/border on it? How to mimic it properly? 
    8. Does discord have some general advice about how to eyeball distances etc when looking at a pic prototype vs making the site? Not sure if mine are correct
        -What font is being used for the labels? How to match when using an image instead of a site where I can check?
    9. Fix margin/padding around bottom of form and above button
